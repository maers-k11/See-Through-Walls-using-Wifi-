# WiFi Radar – Human Detection Using Signal Variations

## Overview

WiFi Radar is a real-time system that detects human movement using fluctuations in WiFi signal strength (RSSI). By analyzing how the signal changes over time, the system identifies motion patterns and estimates the number of people present in an area.

This project combines embedded systems (ESP32) with signal processing and data visualization in Python.

## How It Works

### 1. Signal Acquisition

An ESP32 continuously measures WiFi RSSI values and streams them over serial to a Python program.

### 2. Preprocessing

The raw signal is:

* Smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filtering
* Cleaned to reduce noise and jitter
* Normalized to remove drift

### 3. Motion Extraction

Instead of using raw values directly, the system:

* Removes slow baseline trends
* Computes signal deviation (movement component)
* Converts it into an “energy” signal representing motion intensity

### 4. Thresholding

A dynamic threshold is computed using statistical properties of the signal:

* Median + scaled standard deviation
* Adapts to environmental noise automatically

### 5. Peak Detection

Significant motion events are identified using:

* Minimum peak height
* Prominence filtering (ignores weak noise)
* Minimum width constraints

### 6. Clustering

Nearby peaks are grouped into clusters:

* Each cluster represents a single human movement event
* Prevents overcounting due to jitter

## Visualization

The system generates a smooth, continuous graph of the signal:

* Raw RSSI is interpolated for natural visualization
* Threshold is displayed for reference
* Focus is on clarity and interpretability rather than raw data noise

## Challenges & Learnings

* RSSI data is highly noisy and quantized
* Small signal changes can appear exaggerated
* Over-smoothing removes useful information
* Proper thresholding is critical for accuracy
* Visualization must balance realism and clarity
